                            MetaMask AI Hackathon 2025
                               Duration: 5-6 Minutes
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 1: OPENING HOOK (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"How many of you have ever missed a perfect buying opportunity because you 
weren't watching the charts at 3 AM?"

[PAUSE FOR EFFECT]

"Last month, ETH dropped 8% in a flash crash. By the time most people woke up, 
it had already recovered. The opportunity was gone."

"What if you could sleep peacefully, knowing an AI agent was watching the 
market for you - and actually executing trades on your behalf?"

"Today, I'm excited to introduce ChainAgent - the first autonomous DCA 
platform powered by MetaMask's new Advanced Permissions standard."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Let's talk about Dollar-Cost Averaging - or DCA. It's one of the most 
proven investment strategies, especially for volatile assets like crypto."

"The problem? It requires CONSTANT attention."

THREE PAIN POINTS:

1. "You need to manually execute trades at specific intervals"
2. "You miss opportunities when prices dip unexpectedly"  
3. "Existing solutions require you to give up custody of your funds"

"Current DEX aggregators can help with swaps, but they can't ACT on your 
behalf. You still need to initiate every transaction."

"And centralized exchanges? They require you to deposit your funds - 
giving up custody and control."

"We asked ourselves: What if we could have the automation of centralized 
services with the security of self-custody?"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION - CHAINAGENT (60 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"ChainAgent is an autonomous DCA platform that uses MetaMask's ERC-7715 
Advanced Permissions to safely automate your crypto investments."

[DEMO THE LANDING PAGE]

"Here's how it works in three simple steps:"

STEP 1: GRANT PERMISSION
"You connect your MetaMask wallet and set your parameters:
 - Daily USDC limit (say $100)
 - Duration (30 days)
 - Buy trigger (when ETH drops 5%)"

"This creates a TIME-BOUND, AMOUNT-LIMITED permission grant using the 
wallet_grantPermissions RPC method. Your funds never leave your wallet."

STEP 2: AGENT MONITORS
"Our CoordinatorAgent, deployed on Sepolia, receives this permission and 
monitors the market 24/7. When ETH price drops by your threshold, it 
activates."

STEP 3: AUTOMATIC EXECUTION
"The CoordinatorAgent issues a SUB-DELEGATION to our ExecutionAgent using 
the ERC-7710 delegation framework. The ExecutionAgent then swaps your USDC 
for ETH on Uniswap - all within your approved limits."

"The ETH lands directly in YOUR wallet. Not ours. Yours."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 4: LIVE DEMO (90 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NAVIGATE TO DASHBOARD]

"Let me show you the live dashboard."

"Here you can see:
 - Real-time connection to Sepolia testnet
 - Live block updates - watch this number increment
 - Your configured DCA parameters"

[POINT TO LIVE STATUS]

"The Live Status card shows real-time data pulled directly from our smart 
contracts using wagmi hooks with automatic 5-second polling and block-based 
refresh."

[POINT TO TIMELINE]

"The History Timeline - powered by Envio's HyperIndex - shows every action:
 - Permission granted
 - Sub-delegation issued
 - Swaps executed
 - ETH transferred"

[CLICK GRANT PERMISSION]

"When you click 'Grant Permission & Start', MetaMask prompts you to approve. 
Notice - we're NOT asking for unlimited approval. We're asking for:
 - A specific daily limit
 - A specific total limit
 - A specific time duration"

"This is the power of ERC-7715 - granular, revocable, time-bound permissions."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 5: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (60 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Let me break down the technical stack:"

SMART CONTRACTS (Solidity + Hardhat):

"We deployed three contracts to Sepolia:

1. MockPriceOracle - Simulates Chainlink price feeds. Returns ETH price with 
   8-decimal precision. Supports price dip simulation for demo purposes.

2. CoordinatorAgent - The brain of our system. It:
   - Receives permissions via receivePermission()
   - Tracks daily and total spending limits
   - Issues sub-delegations to ExecutionAgent
   - Emits events: PermissionGranted, SubDelegationIssued

3. ExecutionAgent - The executor. It:
   - Validates delegated authority from Coordinator
   - Executes swaps via Uniswap V3 Router
   - Transfers acquired ETH to user's wallet
   - Tracks global and per-user statistics"

FRONTEND (Next.js 16 + wagmi + viem):

"Our frontend uses:
 - wagmi for React hooks-based Web3 integration
 - viem for low-level Ethereum interactions
 - useBlockNumber with watch: true for real-time updates
 - TanStack Query for efficient data caching and polling"

INDEXING (Envio HyperIndex):

"All contract events are indexed via Envio, providing:
 - GraphQL API for querying historical data
 - Sub-second indexing latency
 - Type-safe event handlers"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 6: SECURITY & TRUST MODEL (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Now, let's address the elephant in the room: 'Why should I trust your agents?'"

"Great question. Here's our security model:"

1. NON-CUSTODIAL
   "Your funds NEVER leave your wallet. Agents can only move assets within 
   your pre-approved limits."

2. TIME-BOUND PERMISSIONS
   "Every permission has an expiration. 7 days, 30 days, 90 days - you 
   choose. After that, auto-revoke."

3. DAILY LIMITS
   "Even within the permission window, agents are capped at your daily 
   limit. A 100 USDC/day limit means that's the maximum exposure per day."

4. ON-CHAIN TRANSPARENCY
   "Every action is recorded on-chain and indexed via Envio. You can verify 
   every swap, every delegation, every transfer."

5. REVOCABLE ANYTIME
   "Changed your mind? Revoke the permission instantly through the dashboard."

"This is the future of autonomous finance - trustless by design."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 7: MARKET OPPORTUNITY (30 seconds)  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"The DCA market is massive:"

- "Coinbase reports over $2 billion in recurring buys set up by users"
- "DeFiLlama tracks $50+ billion in DEX volume monthly"
- "ERC-7715 is brand new - we're first movers in this space"

"ChainAgent bridges CeFi convenience with DeFi security. We're not just 
building a product - we're establishing a new paradigm for autonomous 
on-chain agents."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 8: ROADMAP & VISION (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Where do we go from here?"

PHASE 1 (NOW): 
"DCA automation with price-dip triggers on Sepolia testnet"

PHASE 2: 
"Mainnet deployment + Multi-token support (WBTC, stablecoins)"

PHASE 3: 
"Advanced strategies - Grid trading, limit orders, yield farming delegation"

PHASE 4: 
"AI-powered strategy recommendations using on-chain analytics"

"Our vision: A world where AI agents work FOR you, not against you - 
with full transparency and user control."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDE 9: CLOSING & CTA (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"To summarize:"

"ChainAgent is:
 ✓ The first DCA platform using ERC-7715 Advanced Permissions
 ✓ Fully non-custodial - your funds, your wallet
 ✓ Real-time monitoring with Envio indexing
 ✓ Multi-agent architecture with sub-delegation support
 ✓ Built in 48 hours for this hackathon"

"We're not just automating trades. We're pioneering a new model for 
human-agent collaboration in DeFi."

"Thank you. The future of autonomous finance starts here."

[PAUSE]

"I'm happy to take any questions."
