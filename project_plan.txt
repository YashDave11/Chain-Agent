for the
MetaMask Advanced Permissions Dev Cook-Off
Build Smarter, Safer, and Seamless Web3 Experiences with MetaMask
hackathon
Description

The MetaMask Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715)  invites developers, designers, and innovators to build next-generation Web3 experiences focused on permissions, and Wallet UX.

About Advanced Permissions

The Smart Accounts Kit supports Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715), which lets you request fine-grained permissions from a MetaMask user to execute transactions on their behalf. 

For example, a user can grant your dapp permission to spend 10 USDC per day to buy ETH over the course of a month. Once the permission is granted, your dapp can use the allocated 10 USDC each day to purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask user's account.

About Envio

Envio is a high-performance blockchain indexer designed to track events and state changes across multiple networks with speed and efficiency. Built on its HyperSync engine, it enables developers to easily query blockchain data through GraphQL, providing real-time, production-ready APIs.

Qualification Requirements

The project should use MetaMask Advanced Permissions. Advanced Permissions are only supported on the chains that have EIP-7702 support. Check the supported networks.

To integrate Advanced Permissions use the Smart Accounts Kit.

The project demo video should have a working Advanced Permissions depicted in the main flow of the application.

The judges can decide not to reward a track prize if no project meets the standards set by them internally, apart from the basic submission criteria.

If you are using Envio, the project demo should show how you are using Envio in the project.

Problem Statement
Most creative use of Advanced Permissions

Judging Criteria

Build a new project using Advanced Permissions. This track is for teams creating a new project during the hackathon and integrating Advanced Permissions into their workflow. Builders are free to choose what they want to build.

Possible Directions

Build an agentic dApp using Advanced Permissions. Your project can also leverage ERC-8004 for agent registry.

Payment subscriptions service.

An agent receives a permission to spend 10 USDC per day and re-delegates a 5 USDC per day permission to another agent, creating an A2A (agent-to-agent) flow.

An automation platform for DCA, Recurring swap, Limit orders, powered by Advanced Permissions.

APPROCH:

🎯 THE WINNING IDEA: "ChainAgent" - An AI-Powered DCA Automation + Agent Marketplace
Here's why this wins:

Solves REAL pain: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is how normal people invest in crypto. No one does it manually.

Demonstrates ALL requirements: Advanced Permissions (spending limit) + Agent-to-Agent delegation + Envio (tracking permission redemptions)

Judges see the creative use case: Not boring payment subscription—it's orchestrating multiple agents with nested permissions.

Demo is dramatic: You show a permission being granted, agents executing, and Envio showing the transaction history in real-time.

🏗️ ARCHITECTURE (The Winning Blueprint)
Layer 1: Permission Setup (The User Experience)
User (MetaMask) 
    ↓
Grants permission to "ChainAgent" (session account)
  - Spend 100 USDC/day
  - Duration: 30 days
  - Auto-buy ETH when price drops 5%
    ↓
MetaMask Smart Account created
User funds it with 3000 USDC (30 days × 100)

Layer 2: The Agent (Where The Magic Happens)
ChainAgent receives permission
    ↓
Listens to price feeds (Pyth, Chainlink - on-chain)
    ↓
When BUY condition met → "RoutingAgent" called
    ↓
RoutingAgent receives sub-delegation:
  - Can spend only 100 USDC per day
  - Re-delegates 50 USDC to "ExecutorAgent"
    ↓
ExecutorAgent executes actual swap on Uniswap/CoW Protocol
    ↓
Sends bought ETH back to user's main wallet

Why This Is Genius: You've got A2A (Agent-to-Agent) delegation happening automatically. Judges love seeing permission constraints being enforced at each layer.

Layer 3: Envio Indexing (Judge's Favorite Feature)
Envio tracks every:
  - wallet_grantPermissions call
  - Permission redeem action
  - Sub-delegation issued by RoutingAgent
  - Final ETH transfer to user
    ↓
Dashboard shows real-time timeline:
  "Day 1: 100 USDC delegated → 50 to Executor → Bought 0.035 ETH"
  "Day 2: Permission available: 100 USDC (fresh daily quota)"
  "Day 3: Executor delegated only 30 USDC, spent 20, returned 10"

This proves you're using Envio meaningfully—judges see the full permission lifecycle tracked on-chain.

📋 TECHNICAL BREAKDOWN (No Code, Just Approach)
Backend Stack:
Permission Management: MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit + ERC-7715

Price Monitoring: Chainlink Functions or Pyth on-chain

Execution: CoW Protocol (built for agent automation) OR Uniswap V4 (new, flexible)

Indexing: Envio HyperSync (GraphQL API to fetch permission history)

Chain: Ethereum mainnet (EIP-7702 native support) OR Optimism (also fully supported)

Frontend Stack:
Dashboard: React + TailwindCSS (like you normally build)

Wallet Integration: MetaMask SDK for permission requests

Real-time UI: GraphQL subscriptions to Envio for live permission tracking

Agent Status Panel: Shows which agent executed, when, how much spent
 TACTICAL ADVANTAGES
Narrative is tight: "We're building the future of hands-off DeFi investing"

Technical depth is obvious: A2A delegation is non-trivial to implement

Envio is central, not bolted-on: It's not "we added Envio" it's "Envio powers the audit trail"

Real product energy: Demo looks like a real dapp, not a hackathon prototype

Extensibility: You can say "Next: yield farming automation, limit orders, governance voting"

OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE
You understand architectural abstraction. Most hackathon teams don't.

You're building three layers of agents, not one. Most teams build one.

Your Envio integration is architectural, not cosmetic. Most teams add it last.

Your demo shows constraints being enforced (permission runs out, next day it resets). Most demos show a button working.

🔥 FINAL PUNCH
When judges ask "Why Advanced Permissions over regular transactions?"

You answer: "Because the user grants ONE permission on Day 1, then walks away. For 30 days, agents autonomously execute within the constraints. If you used regular transactions, the user would need to approve 30 swaps. Advanced Permissions is the only way to build truly automated DeFi for normal people."

That's the moment they know you've won.
