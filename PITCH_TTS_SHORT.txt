                    CHAINAGENT - TTS PITCH SCRIPT (UNDER 5 MIN)
                         With Emotional Delivery Cues
================================================================================

[warm, conversational] Hey everyone.

[leaning in, curious] Quick question... how many of you have missed a perfect 
buying opportunity because you weren't watching charts at 3 AM? 

[chuckles knowingly] Yeah, thought so.

[storytelling voice] Last month, ETH dropped eight percent in a flash crash. 
[speeds up] By the time most of us woke up? [disappointed sigh] Already recovered. 
Opportunity gone.

[building excitement] But what if... [dramatic pause] what if an AI agent could 
watch the market for you... [emphasizing] and actually execute trades while you sleep?

[proudly] Today, I'm introducing ChainAgent! [pause] The first autonomous DCA 
platform using MetaMask's brand new ERC-7715 Advanced Permissions.

---

[shifts to serious] Here's the problem with Dollar-Cost Averaging.

[frustrated] It requires constant attention. You manually execute trades. 
You miss unexpected dips. [sarcastically] And centralized exchanges? 
[scoffs] They want custody of your funds. No thanks.

[thoughtfully] We asked: What if we could have CeFi automation... 
with DeFi self-custody?

---

[brightening] ChainAgent does exactly that. Three simple steps.

[counting] Step One: You connect MetaMask, set your parameters. 
Daily limit, duration, price trigger. [reassuringly] Your funds never leave 
your wallet.

[continuing] Step Two: Our Coordinator Agent monitors prices twenty-four-seven. 
[whispers dramatically] When ETH dips... [snaps fingers] it activates.

[building] Step Three: The Coordinator issues a sub-delegation to our 
Execution Agent. [excited] It swaps USDC for ETH on Uniswap... within your 
approved limits.

[triumphantly, slow] The ETH lands in YOUR wallet. Not ours. Yours.

---

[demo voice] Let me show you the live dashboard!

[pointing] Real-time Sepolia connection. [impressed] Watch the block number 
update live! Our wagmi hooks poll every five seconds.

[gesturing] The History Timeline, powered by Envio HyperIndex, tracks 
everything: permissions granted, delegations issued, swaps executed.

[important] And when you grant permission... [emphasizing] we're NOT asking 
for unlimited approval. Just specific daily limits. Specific duration. 
[proudly] That's ERC-7715. Granular. Revocable. Time-bound.

---

[addressing skeptics] Now... "Why trust your agents?"

[confident, listing quickly]
One: Non-custodial. Funds never leave your wallet.
Two: Time-bound. Permissions auto-expire.
Three: Daily capped. Maximum exposure per day.
Four: On-chain. Every action verified on Etherscan.
[empowering] Five: Revocable anytime. One click.

[profound] Trustless by design.

---

[energized] The opportunity is massive. Two billion dollars in Coinbase 
recurring buys. Fifty billion in monthly DEX volume. 
[excitedly] And ERC-7715 is brand new! We're first movers.

[visionary] ChainAgent bridges CeFi convenience with DeFi security.

---

[wrapping up, powerful] To summarize:

[listing proudly] First DCA platform using ERC-7715. Fully non-custodial. 
Real-time Envio indexing. Multi-agent sub-delegation architecture. 
[impressively] Built in forty-eight hours.

[passionate] We're not just automating trades. We're pioneering human-agent 
collaboration in DeFi.

[warm, grateful] Thank you. [long pause]

[smiling] The future of autonomous finance starts here.

[open] Questions?
