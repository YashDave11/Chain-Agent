                    CHAINAGENT - TEXT-TO-SPEECH PITCH SCRIPT
                         With Emotional Delivery Cues
================================================================================

[confident, warm tone] Hello everyone. [brief pause]

[leaning in, curious] How many of you have ever missed a perfect buying 
opportunity... [dramatically] because you weren't watching the charts at 3 AM?

[knowing chuckle] Yeah, I see those nods.

[storytelling voice] Last month, ETH dropped eight percent in a flash crash. 
[speeds up slightly] By the time most people woke up, it had already recovered. 
[disappointed sigh] The opportunity? Gone.

[building excitement] But what if... [pause for effect] what if you could sleep 
peacefully, knowing an AI agent was watching the market for you... 
[emphasizing each word] and actually executing trades on your behalf?

[proudly, with energy] Today, I'm excited to introduce ChainAgent! 
[pause] The first autonomous DCA platform powered by MetaMask's brand new 
Advanced Permissions standard.

---

[transitioning, more serious] Let's talk about Dollar-Cost Averaging, or DCA. 
[matter-of-fact] It's one of the most proven investment strategies, especially 
for volatile assets like crypto.

[frustrated tone] The problem? [sighs] It requires CONSTANT attention.

[counting on fingers, emphasizing each point]
One: You need to manually execute trades at specific intervals.
Two: You miss opportunities when prices dip unexpectedly.
[slightly annoyed] And three: Existing solutions require you to give up 
custody of your funds.

[sarcastically] Current DEX aggregators can help with swaps, sure... 
[mimics disappointment] but they can't ACT on your behalf. You still need to 
initiate every. single. transaction.

[dismissive] And centralized exchanges? [scoffs] They require you to deposit 
your funds, giving up custody and control. [shakes head] No thank you.

[thoughtfully] We asked ourselves: [pause] What if we could have the automation 
of centralized services... [building] with the security of self-custody?

---

[brightening up, proud] ChainAgent is an autonomous DCA platform that uses 
MetaMask's ERC-seven-seven-one-five Advanced Permissions to safely automate 
your crypto investments.

[enthusiastic] Here's how it works in three simple steps!

[holding up finger] Step One: Grant Permission.
[explaining clearly] You connect your MetaMask wallet and set your parameters. 
Daily USDC limit... say a hundred dollars. Duration... thirty days. 
Buy trigger... when ETH drops five percent.

[technical but accessible] This creates a TIME-BOUND, AMOUNT-LIMITED permission 
grant using the wallet underscore grant Permissions RPC method. 
[reassuringly] Your funds never leave your wallet.

[continuing] Step Two: Agent Monitors.
[descriptive] Our Coordinator Agent, deployed on Sepolia testnet, receives this 
permission and monitors the market... [whispers dramatically] twenty-four-seven. 
[normal voice] When ETH price drops by your threshold... [snaps fingers] 
it activates.

[building momentum] Step Three: Automatic Execution!
[explaining with energy] The Coordinator Agent issues a SUB-DELEGATION to our 
Execution Agent using the ERC-seven-seven-one-zero delegation framework. 
The Execution Agent then swaps your USDC for ETH on Uniswap...

[pausing for emphasis] ...all within your approved limits.

[triumphantly, pointing] The ETH lands directly in YOUR wallet. 
[slowly, emphasizing] Not ours. Yours.

---

[excited, demo mode] Now let me show you the live dashboard!

[pointing at screen] Here you can see... real-time connection to Sepolia testnet. 
[impressed tone] Look at this... live block updates! Watch this number increment.

[enthusiastically] The Live Status card shows real-time data pulled directly 
from our smart contracts using wagmi hooks with automatic five-second polling 
and block-based refresh.

[gesturing] And this... [appreciating] the History Timeline! 
Powered by Envio's HyperIndex. It shows every action:
[listing] Permission granted... sub-delegation issued... swaps executed... 
ETH transferred.

[demonstrating] When you click "Grant Permission and Start"... 
[attention-grabbing] Notice! We're NOT asking for unlimited approval.

[carefully] We're asking for: a specific daily limit, a specific total limit, 
and a specific time duration.

[proud] THIS is the power of ERC-seven-seven-one-five. 
[emphasizing each word] Granular. Revocable. Time-bound permissions.

---

[shifting to technical, knowledgeable tone] Let me break down the technical stack.

[counting] We deployed three contracts to Sepolia:

[first finger] One: Mock Price Oracle. 
[explaining] Simulates Chainlink price feeds. Returns ETH price with 
eight-decimal precision. Supports price dip simulation for demos.

[second finger] Two: Coordinator Agent. [impressed] The brain of our system.
It receives permissions via the receive Permission function, tracks daily 
and total spending limits, issues sub-delegations to Execution Agent, and 
emits events like Permission Granted and Sub-Delegation Issued.

[third finger] Three: Execution Agent. [decisive] The executor.
It validates delegated authority, executes swaps via Uniswap V-three Router, 
transfers acquired ETH to user's wallet, and tracks global and per-user statistics.

[nodding] Our frontend uses Next.js sixteen with wagmi and viem for 
React hooks-based Web-three integration.

[impressed whisper] And all contract events? 
[normal] Indexed via Envio HyperIndex with sub-second latency.

---

[addressing concerns, serious] Now... let's address the elephant in the room.

[skeptical voice, mimicking audience] "Why should I trust your agents?"

[smiling] Great question.

[confident, counting] Here's our security model:

[firmly] One: Non-custodial. Your funds NEVER leave your wallet. 
Agents can only move assets within your pre-approved limits.

[reassuring] Two: Time-bound permissions. Every permission has an expiration. 
Seven days, thirty days, ninety days... you choose. After that? Auto-revoke.

[protective] Three: Daily limits. Even within the permission window, 
agents are capped at your daily limit. [example] A hundred USDC per day limit 
means that's the MAXIMUM exposure. Per. Day.

[transparent] Four: On-chain transparency. Every action is recorded on-chain 
and indexed via Envio. You can verify every swap, every delegation, every transfer.

[empowering] Five: Revocable anytime. Changed your mind? 
[snaps] Revoke the permission instantly through the dashboard.

[profound] This is the future of autonomous finance... 
[slowly] trustless by design.

---

[energized, opportunity] The DCA market is MASSIVE.

[citing] Coinbase reports over two billion dollars in recurring buys set up 
by users. DeFi Llama tracks fifty-plus billion in DEX volume monthly.

[excitedly] And ERC-seven-seven-one-five is brand new! 
[confidently] We're first movers in this space.

[visionary] ChainAgent bridges CeFi convenience with DeFi security. 
We're not just building a product... [building] we're establishing a new 
paradigm for autonomous on-chain agents.

---

[future-focused] Where do we go from here?

[listing] Phase One, now: DCA automation with price-dip triggers on Sepolia.

Phase Two: Mainnet deployment plus multi-token support... WBTC, stablecoins.

[getting excited] Phase Three: Advanced strategies! Grid trading, limit orders, 
yield farming delegation.

[dreaming big] Phase Four: AI-powered strategy recommendations using on-chain 
analytics.

[inspirational] Our vision? [pause] A world where AI agents work FOR you, 
not against you... with full transparency and user control.

---

[wrapping up, powerful] To summarize.

[proudly listing]
ChainAgent is... the first DCA platform using ERC-seven-seven-one-five 
Advanced Permissions.

Fully non-custodial... your funds, your wallet.

Real-time monitoring with Envio indexing.

Multi-agent architecture with sub-delegation support.

[impressively] And built in just forty-eight hours for this hackathon.

[passionate] We're not just automating trades. 
[building to climax] We're pioneering a new model for human-agent 
collaboration in DeFi.

[grateful, warm] Thank you.

[pause, profound] The future of autonomous finance... starts here.

[smiling, open] I'm happy to take any questions.
